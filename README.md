- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sean Hunter (@huntse on github). My personal website is [https://uncarved.com](https://uncarved.com) although it doesn't see updates on any sort of non-geological timespan. I have a self-study project in obsidian so if you're looking for resources to learn AI and ML stuff and the maths behind it, a good starting point is [here](https://publish.obsidian.md/uncarved/3+Resources/Public/self+study+resources+for+AI+and+machine+learning)

If you're a recruiter, please don't contact me to pitch your services. You guys do great work but I'm not in the market for a new job at the moment and I also don't source candidates for my current employer (that would be the
in-house recruiting team) so you're just wasting both of our time.

In particular, _I am not looking for scala programming jobs_. It blows my mind that I have scala repos that haven't had a single commit in 5+ years and you guys contact me to pitch IC scala programming roles.

huntse/huntse is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
